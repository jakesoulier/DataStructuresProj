# Queues
## Introduction
What is a Queue?
A queue is form of data structure in programming.  It is a group of data elements where only the first part of the data can be accessed.  The order is FIFO or first in, first out.
## Implementation
Can you think of any real world examples of a queue?  Let me give you one to get you started.  When you go to the sandwhich shop, you have to get in line to wait for your order.  You join at the back of the line.  That's where data is inserted for a queue.  Who gets served first?  That would be the first person in line.  They are the first out.

Here is an image example of a queue:

## Deque
Deque, also called Double Ended Queue, is a type of Queue that allows of removal and insertion of elements can be done at the back or front of a collection of data.  This means it does not follow the first in first out rule.  There are a couple of different main operations inside of Deque.  Here they are:

insertFront()

insertBack()

deleteFront()

deleteBack()
