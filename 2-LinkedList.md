# Linked List
## Introduction
What is a Linked List?

They are also called a one way ordered list.  That is exactly what they are, an ordered group of elements that have a connection to each value next in line.  Basically, it is a linear order set of elements that connect each other with pointers.
## Implementation
Let's think of a real world example of a linked list.  This always helps me understand principles and see the importance of them.  Maybe you will start to see examples of linked lists in your day-to-day life!  Here's a real life example:

Imagine you are listening to your music library on shuffle.  Each time you skip or finish a song, a new, random song starts to play and is added to a linked list.  The last song points to your new song.  If you listen to multiple songs, you can go back a couple songs to one you were previously enjoying by pressing reverse and going back song by song.  All of the previous songs are still pointed to each other.  Another reason this is a linked list is the new song is not added until you finish your current song, just like a linked list.  They have data added to them at runtime.  

Here is an image example of a linked list:

## Efficiency
Linked list uses sequential access.  This is just a term that means data is accessed with some type of preset, ordered by retrieving form.  Since linked lists are accessed this way and are already linearly organized the big O efficiently is O(n).
