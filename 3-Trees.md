# Trees
## Introduction
What are trees in a data structure and algorithmic definition?

Trees are a bit different from the past 2 topics that we have talked about. Instead of having the data organized in a linear matter like in queues and linked lists, trees use a hierarchcy data structure to organize its data.  There are many different types of trees, the main type we are going to focus on today are binary trees.
## Implementation
Let's think of a real world example of a linked list.  This always helps me understand principles and see the importance of them.  Maybe you will start to see examples of linked lists in your day-to-day life!  Here's a real life example:

Imagine you are listening to your music library on shuffle.  Each time you skip or finish a song, a new, random song starts to play and is added to a linked list.  The last song points to your new song.  If you listen to multiple songs, you can go back a couple songs to one you were previously enjoying by pressing reverse and going back song by song.  All of the previous songs are still pointed to each other.  Another reason this is a linked list is the new song is not added until you finish your current song, just like a linked list.  They have data added to them at runtime.  

Here is an image example of a linked list:

## Efficiency
Linked list uses sequential access.  This is just a term that means data is accessed with some type of preset, ordered by retrieving form.  Since linked lists are accessed this way and are already linearly organized the big O efficiently is O(n).


## Problem to Solve

Use this code to start and write answers:

There are 3 main task you need to complete:

* Insert data into head of list
* Insert data into tail of list
* Insert data into list after another list element

**Answer should output:**
